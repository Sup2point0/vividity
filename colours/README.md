# Colour Palettes

Here you’ll find the JSON definitions for all the colour palettes. These all conform to the JSON Schema over in [technicalities](../technicals/schema.json).

If you want these in a different format – say, CSS variables – view them on the [site](https://sup2point0.github.io/vividity/colours) where many are provided.

Enjoy!
